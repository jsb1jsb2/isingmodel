Ising model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)

Project consists of two part, analytical(mathematical) solution and numerical solution.
Analytical solution is derived from the way created by mathematical proof of Ising which is exact solution.
Numerical solution is derived from Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) method and is approximation not a exact solution.
Analytical and numerical solution is firstly explained each and then compared.

Finished in 2022 summer semester.
